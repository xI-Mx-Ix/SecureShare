# Secure Share 🛡️

I built Secure Share because I was tired of hitting the **10MB upload limit on Discord**.

Trying to share a quick game clip, a project zip, or a high-res image shouldn't require uploading it to Google Drive, messing with link permissions, and waiting for the upload to finish before my friends can even start downloading.

I wanted something where **I** am the server. I choose a folder, send a link, and they grab the files directly from my machine. Fast, local, and no cloud middleman.

## What is this?

Secure Share is a local file-sharing server with a dedicated Admin Panel. It gives you complete control over the connection.

*   **You are in Charge:** You host the files. The data never leaves your network until someone downloads it.
*   **Approval System:** Don't want people grabbing everything? Turn on "Require Approval." When a client clicks download, you get a popup on your dashboard to Approve or Reject it.
*   **Emergency Pause:** Need to cut access? Hit the pause switch. The client's screen blurs instantly, and downloads are blocked.
*   **Dynamic Hosting:** You can switch the shared folder on the fly without restarting the server.

## Getting Started

You only need Python. No complex setup.

### 1. Requirements
Just make sure you have Python installed.

### 2. Install
We use Flask for the web server. Install it via terminal:

```bash
pip install flask
```

### 3. Run it
Start the app:

```bash
python app.py
```

The Admin Panel will open automatically in your browser.

## How to use

### 👮 For You (The Admin)
* **Dashboard:** Go to the URL shown in your terminal (`http://localhost:XXXXX/admin`). The port is random each time you start the server.
* **Pick a Folder:** Use the browse button to select what you want to share.
* **Set a Password:** Keep strangers out.
* **Control:** Use the toggle switches to go Offline, Pause the UI, or enable Approval Mode.
* **Port Access:** If your friends connect from outside your network, **you need to set up port forwarding** on your router or use a **tunnel (like ngrok)** so they can reach your server.

### 👤 For Your Friends (The Clients)
* Connect using your public IP and port (e.g., `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:XXXXX`).
* Log in with the password you set.
* Browse and download. If you enabled approvals, you'll see a "Waiting for Approval" status while the admin decides.
